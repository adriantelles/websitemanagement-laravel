# Website Management

**Note: This is not recommended for production use just yet, still removing some business details as hard-coded strings.**

This application is a website built with Laravel, Vue.js and the Bulma CSS framework. It is designed to be a simple website with a portal to allow clients to create new emails, change passwords, and check their disk usage.

There is also simple invoicing functionality built-in which will become optional and removable in the future.

## TODO

- [ ] Remove all references to Geckode website.
- [ ] Make invoicing details dynamic.
- [ ] Escape/Filter WHM function calls.
- [ ] Add a default invoice note setting.
- [ ] Rewrite as many tests without using Laravel Dusk as possible.
